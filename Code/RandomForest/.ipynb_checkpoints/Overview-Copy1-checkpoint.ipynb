    "Our clients are local news stations who are interested in increasing engagement on their Facebook posts. The primary goal of this project is to develop an algorithm capable of predicting whether a post will have high or low engagement/consumption based on their content. Such a predictive algorithm can greatly help the news stations preselect articles for their facebook feed and tune the content of the message to better engage their audience on facebook and increase the number of clicks on their website.\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish this goal, we had to answer several key questions\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the suitable metrics for quantifying engagement and consumption on Facebook?\n",
    "- Can we classify facebook posts into different topics just based on the content of their messages?\n",
    "- Can we predict the degree of engagement or consumption just from on the content of their messages?\n",
    "- Can we draw crucial business insights that can increase engagement / consumption / revenue for the new stations?"
